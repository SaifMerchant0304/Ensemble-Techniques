**Ensemble-Techniques**

**_Project Overview:_**

* Objective: Develop a predictive model to identify potential churn among telecom customers, aiding in the implementation of focused customer retention strategies.
* Skills & Tools Covered: EDA, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Boosting techniques.


_Domain: Telecom_

_Data Description:_

* Each row represents a customer, with columns detailing customer attributes, services subscribed to, account information, and demographic data.
* Key columns include churn status, services subscribed, account details, and demographic information.


**_Steps and Tasks:_**

_Data Understanding & Exploration:_

* Read two CSV files and merge them based on 'customerID' key.
* Verify the incorporation of all columns into the merged DataFrame.


_Data Cleaning & Analysis:_

* Impute missing/unexpected values.
* Ensure continuous value variables are of 'Float' type.
* Generate pie charts for categorical features to visualize percentage distribution.
* Insights from pie charts.
* Encode categorical features appropriately.
* Split data into 80% train and 20% test sets.
* Normalize/Standardize the data.


_Model Building and Performance Improvement:_

* Train a Decision Tree model and evaluate its performance on both train and test data.
* Utilize grid search to enhance Decision Tree model performance and compare it with the initial model.
* Train a Random Forest model and assess its performance on train and test data.
* Improve Random Forest model performance through grid search and compare results.
* Train an Adaboost model and evaluate its performance on train and test data.
* Enhance Adaboost model performance using grid search and compare with initial model.
* Train a GradientBoost model and check its performance on train and test data.
* Use grid search to improve GradientBoost model performance and analyze the differences.


_Detailed analysis:_

* Compare performance of each model in train and test stages.
* Observation on the best performing model.
* Reasoning behind the best performing model.
* Final conclusion based on observations.


_Model Performance Analysis:_

* Decision Tree Model: Initial Performance: (Train) & (Test) Grid Search Performance: (Train) & (Test)
* Random Forest Model: Initial Performance: (Train) & (Test) Grid Search Performance: (Train) & (Test)
* Adaboost Model: Initial Performance: (Train) & (Test) Grid Search Performance: (Train) & (Test)
* GradientBoost Model: Initial Performance: (Train) & (Test) Grid Search Performance: (Train) & (Test)


_**Observations and Conclusion:**_

* Comparison of model performances at different stages.
* Identification of the best performing model.
* Reasoning behind the superior performance.
* Final conclusion and recommendations for model deployment and further actions.


By following these steps and analyzing the performance of various ensemble techniques, the telecom company can effectively predict customer churn and implement targeted retention strategies, thus enhancing customer satisfaction and reducing churn rates.
